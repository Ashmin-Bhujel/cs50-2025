CS50 is a course by Harvard University for everyone to learn foundations of computer science and art of programming.

## Number Systems

### Unary

In unary number system `Base-1` we can assign each object a number for counting.

### Binary

In binary number system `Base-2` we can only use two digits `0 and 1` to represent numbers. Bit is just a binary digit, whose value can be either `0 or 1`. We can make group of bits, such as `1 Nibble = 4 bits`, `1 Byte = 8 bits or 2 Nibbles`. We can use transistors to store binary information.

### Decimal

The number system that we use in daily life is decimal number system `Base-10`. We can use digits from `0 to 9` to represent numbers.

## Representing data

### ASCII

ASCII stands for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`. We can represent alphabetical letters or numbers using binary values. e.g. We can assign uppercase letter `A` a binary value of `01000001` which is number `65` in decimal. In ASCII we can use `8 bits` to represent these binary values. It supports 2 raised to the power of 8 i.e. `256` different binary values.

### Unicode

Unicode was developed to overcome the limitations of ASCII. It is basically superset of ASCII. It is backward compatible with ASCII. Unicode supports 2 raised to the power of 32 i.e. roughly 4 billions different binary values.

### Data Types

We can use the same combination of binary values to represent different kinds of data in different contexts. Characters, numbers, colors, images, videos and sounds are some of the data types we see and use.

## Algorithm & Pseudocode

Algorithm is a set of finite and precise step by step instructions. Pseudocode is a formal way of writing algorithms in human readable form. It does not need to be in some programming language it can be written in formal day to day human language.
