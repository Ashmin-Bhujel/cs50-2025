## Number Systems

### Unary Number System

- In unary number system (Base-1) we can assign each object a number for counting.

### Binary Number System

- In binary number system (Base-2) we can only use two digits 0 and 1 to represent numbers.

- Bit is just a binary digit, whose value can be either 0 or 1.

- We can make group of bits, such as 1 Nibble = 4 bits, 1 Byte = 8 bits or 2 Nibbles

- We can use transistors to store binary information.

## Decimal Number System

- The number system that we use in daily life is decimal number system (Base-10).

- We can use digits from 0 to 9 to represent numbers.
