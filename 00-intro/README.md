## Number Systems

### Unary Number System

- In unary number system `Base-1` we can assign each object a number for counting.

### Binary Number System

- In binary number system `Base-2` we can only use two digits `0 and 1` to represent numbers.

- Bit is just a binary digit, whose value can be either `0 or 1`.

- We can make group of bits, such as `1 Nibble = 4 bits`, `1 Byte = 8 bits or 2 Nibbles`

- We can use transistors to store binary information.

### Decimal Number System

- The number system that we use in daily life is decimal number system `Base-10`.

- We can use digits from `0 to 9` to represent numbers.

## Representing different data using binary

### ASCII

- ASCII stands for `American Standard Code for Information Interchange`.

- We can represent alphabetical letter or number using binary so that humans can read and understand it by assigning those alphabetical letters and numbers a binary value. e.g. We can assign uppercase letter `A` a binary value of `01000001` which is number `65` in decimal.

- In ASCII we can use `8 bits` to represent these data.

- It supports 2 raised to the power of 8 i.e. `256` different data values with binary.

### Unicode

- Unicode was developed to overcome the limitations of ASCII.

- It is basically superset of ASCII.

- It has backward compatibility with ASCII codes.

- Unicode supports 2 raised to the power of 32 i.e. roughly 4 billions different data values with binary.
